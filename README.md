# tqcorr

This is a section of the electronic software UNDMOL, developed by Mark R. Hoffmann. This part of the code is realted to the method MRCISD(TQ), and it treats the correlation from the TQ configurations perturbatively. The code uses MPI parallelization. The full UNDMOL must be obtained by contacting Dr. Mark R. Hoffman (mark.hoffmann@und.edu)
